# 2D Engine
With this project i am creating a 2D Engine in C# from Scratch.

The engine is written using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and handles objects, transforms, collisions, drawing and a variety of other usefull stuff used in 2D Game Development.

Inluded features are:
* Game Loop
* Object Drawing
* Object Pooling
* UI Drawing
* Collision
* Sound Manager

# Game Prototype
Included is a Game Prototype, that is similar to [Phoenix 2](https://firigames.com/phoenix2). <br>
Is is a bullet hell space shooting game visualizing a simple game loop with spawning enemies, health and bullets.
